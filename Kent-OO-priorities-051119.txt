three ways to create objects:

literal
contstructor thing that works in ES5
and ES6 class thing

Jason used the Take method (backpacks and Bob) to illustrate callbacks and such

scoping including let versus const and hoisting

Understanding callback:
A function in JS is an object..a specialized object…so it can be passed around
It is common to have function inside of another function

He believes in refactoring, modularity, code reuse and small functions....the idea that any function that won't fit on the screen is too long

Destructure or deconstruct

JS Scroll

Deck of Cards?

=>  ES6 function such as
anElementFromMap => anElementFromMap + 2))}

maybe Google "Map Operations" and "reduce"

Wednesday's lecture was on Callbacks

Promise lecture was Thursday pm

Thursday a.m. Asynch 
all database calls are asynch
---Express much more important than Node direct server work
common to pass in query and callback as with query being the database
--done is JQuerries way of handling promises

Another idea for today:  Start MondoDB with idea to think about callbacks/asynch and Promise
